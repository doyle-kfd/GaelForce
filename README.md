# GaelForce - Marine Weather Data Analysis App

GaelForce is command line marine specific data analysis app focused on the sailing community.
Its data is real life, historical weather data, captured from one of the weather buoys located
around the Irish cost and is part of the Irish weather buoy network.

Refered to as M2 by the Marine Institue, the M2 Weather buoy records hourly environmental data
that can be used by the sailing community, competitive and leisure, to interrogate the data
and see what weather conditions were like on given date ranges.

This data, compared to current predictions, could give advantage to competitors in planning their
strategy for an event on a given date.
